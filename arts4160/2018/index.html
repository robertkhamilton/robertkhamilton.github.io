<div class="course_info">
	<h4>PREREQUISITE</h4>
	<p>ARTS 2020 (Music and Technology I) or permission from instructor.</p>
</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h4>
	<p>Music and Technology II assumes a knowledge and experience in using computer systems to create, manipulate and engage in research within the fields of sound design, electronic music, electroacoustic composition and performance.  The course is directed to upper-level undergraduate and graduate students as a project-based seminar which will guide their progress through the design, researching of and implementation of an individual project within in the course of the semester. This class is divided between a group seminar, focusing on the presentation of the aesthetic/ theoretical/ technical/ historical issues related to the field, and a workshop/lab.</p>
	<p>Topics will be tailored to current issues raised through individual and group interests including but not limited to software design for musical systems, sound design, musical composition, audio engineering topics, micro-processors and physical computing, computer-aided composition and generative music, musical interfaces, musical robotics, sound spatialization, music in games and gaming environments, and theoretical research in music synthesis and composition.  Each student will propose a musical project focus and scope of work for the semester, as well as a basis of the evaluation for individual work.  In this way the hope is to combine the approaches of a music-focused research seminar, private study, guided research and group workshop/practicum.</p>
	<p>Cultural and historical issues will be addressed through a series of student-led discussions of readings, listenings, videos, guest lectures and concerts.  Students will also be asked to make use of the media collection at Folsom Library, as well as on-line access to media collections and journals such as the Computer Music Journal and Leonardo Music Journal.</p>
	<p>The two-hour class sessions will generally be divided between classroom seminar presentation and workshop/lab. The final class session will be an informal presentation of individual projects completed in the class.</p>
	<!--We will be coordinating with EMPAC to provide special events and access to EMPAC artists and residents as might be appropriate to the scheduling and activities presented throughout the semester.  These opportunities may be held outside normal class periods or change our class schedule with little notice.  Please monitor class communications closely. -->

<div class="course_info">
	<h4>STUDIO RESOURCES</h4>
	<p>Throughout this course, you will make use of the resources in the Undergraduate Computer Music Studio (WH110). Students enrolled in the course will have access to the studio 24 hours a day, and should expect to spend several hours working in the studio each week. You will also have access to recording equipment in the equipment room, which you will be checking out from time to time in order to make field recordings.</p>
	<p>When appropriate for an assignment, or to explore sound in general, we encourage the use of your own computer, electronic instruments, etc. Often times, smaller components of a large project can be done on your laptop or home studio facilities and then brought into the main studio to be mixed and mastered.</p>
</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4 style="background-color:#EBEBEB">STATEMENT REGARDING ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</h4>
	<p>The Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities define various forms of Academic Dishonesty and procedures for responding to them. All forms are violations of the trust between students and teachers. Student-teacher relationships are built on trust. For example, students must trust that teachers have made appropriate decisions about the structure and content of the courses they teach, and teachers must trust that the assignments that students turn in are their own performance. Acts that violate this trust undermine the educational process. </p>
</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4 style="background-color:#EBEBEB">Policy on collaboration and cheating/plagiarism</h4>
	<p>Collaboration between students in this course is strongly encouraged. Likewise, students are encouraged—indeed, to some extent required—to exchange ideas, opinions and information. You are also encouraged to help each other in the lab and with performance, production, and presentation of projects.</p>
	<p>Plagiarism of any kind is in direct violation of University policy on Academic Dishonesty as defined in the Rensselaer Handbook, and penalties for plagiarism can be severe. In this class you will be expected to attribute due credit to the originator of any ideas, words, sounds, or music which you incorporate substantially into your own work. This applies particularly to citation and fair usage of sources for media “samples” included in your compositions.</p>
	<p>Please refer to the University policy on Academic Dishonesty as defined in the Rensselaer Handbook for policies and procedures governing Academic Integrity.  As you will be presenting your work several times as you develop it over the course of the semester, any marginal activities relating to  citation and plagiarism will be discussed as you develop your work.</p>
	<p>Work found to be in violation of these policies will not be accepted and you will receive no credit for the work with no ability to make up the assignment.  If the violation occurs in a final project you will fail the course and it will be reported to the Dean of Students.</p>
