	<h4>Assignment #1: Found-Sound Sketch / Radio Play</h4>	
	<b><em>Assigned 9/14, Due 9/25</em></b></br>
	<p>Compose a sonic sketch within <strong>Pro Tools</strong> using as source material the audio samples you recorded during class. This sketch should display your ability to edit and manipulate sound files, as well as organize multiple sonic sources into a cohesive composition.</p>
	<p>This sonic sketch should be approximately <strong><em>4-6 minutes in length</em></strong>.</p>
	<p>Along with the sonic sketch, please submit a <strong><em>visual "reference score"</em></strong> for your work: a .pdf document displaying visually the organizational structures with which you created your sketch. This visual score should be analagous to a written musical score, acting as a deptiction of your work's structure and intention as the work unfolds in time.</p>

	<p>
		<p>Your submission for the assignment will consist of the following files to be uploaded to your folder on the class share drive (<b>\\hass11.win.rpi.edu\classes\ARTS-2020\</b>), into a folder named "Assignment 1":</p>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>A Stereo Mix of your sketch (44.1 or 48kHz, 16 or 24 bit) uploaded to the class share.</li>
				<li>Your full Pro Tools project on the class share.</li>
				<li>A program-note for your sketch, including a title and description of your work (suitable for a concert's program).</li>
				<li>A list of the samples used in your work, including their source, file-name and proper attribution for the creator(s) of the sample.</li>				
			</ol>
		</p>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Please consider making use of the techniques we learned in class such as fading your files in and out, panning and volume automations. Feel free to experiment with effects on your channel inserts, compression, limiting, denoising and normalization.
	</p>
	<p><b>Things to keep in mind:</b> This sketch can take multiple forms depending on your interest. Possibilities include an exploration of ALL the sounds you previously recorded or an in-depth study of one particular sound file or source. Your work can be atmospheric, like a soundscape, with the intention of depicting a specific place and time. Your work can be more "musical" in nature, using your recorded sound sources as instruments within a composed structure. Or a narrative element recorded in the studio can be incorporated, using a voice to shape your project into something resembling a "Radio Play".</p>

	<h4>Assignment #1: FIELD RECORDING</h4>
	<b><em>Assigned 1/27, Due 2/1</em></b></br>
	<p>The natural world around us is an amazing source of sound material. In this context however, the sounds of nature (i.e. burbling brooks, crying loons) are not necessarily the sounds that immerse us in our daily lives. Those sounds are the focus of this assignment, the sounds that make up our own personal Sound Worlds.</p>
	<p>Using a portable audio recorder, your assignment is to create a body of recorded samples that represent sounds from your world. These can be sounds that you consider: <em>beautiful, annoying, horrific, subtle, overt, background noise or foreground sonic experiences.</em>.</p>
	<p>
		<b>To successfully carry out this assignment please follow these instructions:</b>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Check out a portable audio recorder (and microphone if necessary) from the HASS Equipment Room (SAGE 1112).
			</li>
			<li>Familiarize yourself with its operation, specifically how to set the input level, how to record, how to play back your recording on the device, how to copy your files from the device (via USB) to your computer.</li>
			<li>Document the source of your recordings: this can be in the form of photos or video of your recording location/configuration, or as a written description of the material/location being recorded.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Your submission for the assignment will consist of the following files to be uploaded to your folder on the class share drive (<b>\\hass11.win.rpi.edu\classes\ARTS-2020\</b>), into a folder named "Assignment 1":</p>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Your set of at least 5 (no more than 10) high-quality samples.</li>
				<li>A visual (photo) or narrative description of each sample.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>You can contact the equipment room staff at (518) 276-4775, or online at hasshelp [at] rpi [dot] edu.</p>
	</p>
	<p>For the purposes of this assignment, please keep the following suggestions in mind:
		<ul>
			<li>* Set the recorder to record at a high sampling rate (e.g. 44.1kHz) and a bit rate of 16 bit or higher.</li>
			<li>* Make sure the input level for the microphone is set high enough to capture the type of sound that has drawn your attention.</li>
			<li>* Test your setup early and often. TAPE IS CHEAP. If you're not absolutely sure you captured the sound the way you would like, listen to your recording on the spot. Iterate until it sounds the way you'd like.</li>
			<li>* Please respect the privacy of people or material that might wander into your recording. In general, distinct voices or audible musical sources (i.e. radios, music in general) might not be the best source material for this exercise.</li>

	<p><b>Things to keep in mind:</b> This can be a field recording of an environment, or a recording of an object. You should make sure that the recording is done WELL, with a good signal-to-noise ratio, and a minimum of external body noises/mic noises/etc. The length is not as important as the quality, and the characteristics of the sound. You will be working with this recording for the next assignment so think about what you want to do and explore sound through the recorder.</p>

		or
		<li>Using the "Trucks" stems (guitar, vocals, click) found on the Class share drive produce your own version of "Trucks".

 Ultimately, you may which to work within one of the following studio composition "genres" which we will talk more about as we go along:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Soundscape Composition:</b> Following Hildegard Westerkamp’s definition (see the reading on-line), a composition which uses as it’s material a recorded environment, not abstracted, making audible it’s relationship to the original source, or to a place, time, or situation.</li>

<li><b>Musique Concrete Composition: A sound piece which makes use of a recorded object, environment, instrument, etc, as sound material for abstract composition. Here the interest is perhaps more in musical form and structure.</li>


<li><b>Single Sound Source Composition: A sound piece made by transforming and generating material out of a single sound source, such as a drop of water, a car engine, a dog barking, etc.</li>


<li><b>Other ideas that interest YOU. Your composition can be environmental/ ambient or be based on traditional musical structures/ chords/ rhythms etc.</li>

For the tascam dap1 DAT recorder, make sure to have the following settings:
audio input: analog
analog input: mic
sampling rate: 44.1K samples/second
phantom power: on
put in “record mode”
visually monitor levels on the meter and listen to the sound through headphones.
keep the level below “0” Db.
This can be a field recording of an environment, or a recording of an object. You should make sure that the recording is done WELL, with a good signal-to-noise ratio, and a minimum of external body noises/mic noises/etc. The length is not as important as the quality, and the characteristics of the sound. You will be working with this recording for the next several weeks so think about what you want to do and explore sound through the recorder.
