</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4>PREREQUISITE</h4>
	<p>ARTS 1010 (Music and Sound) or permission from instructor.</p>
</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h4>
	<p>This course is an introduction to music and "sound-art" created through the use of computers and electronics. This is a studio course, and students will be expected to participate creatively in class by listening, taking an active role in discussions, and making your own work through significant, intelligent uses of technology. Although a component of this class includes learning how to use computers and other technological tools, this is not a "how-to-use technology" course. We will focus primarily on learning enough about technology to realize personal creative projects.</p>
</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4>CATALOG DESCRIPTION</h4>
	<p>Music composition taught in the context of modern computerized production methods. Technical topics include basic principles of computer sound generation, digital sound sampling, and the use of small computers for musical control of electronic instruments. Musical topics include a study of important musical works and compositional techniques of the 20th century. Student projects involve hands-on work on a variety of computer instruments and software. This course is a prerequisite for further creative work with Rensselaer's computer music facilities.</p>
</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4>LEARNING OUTCOMES</h4>
	<ol style="width:700px">
		Students who successfully complete this course will demonstrate...
		<li>an understanding and appreciation of computer music through an awareness
of the many disciplines underlying the field including: listening skills, musical theory,
musical acoustics, psycho-acoustics, software design and programming, digital audio theory, and digital signal
processing.</li>
		<li>basic technical facility in the areas of audio recording, editing, sound synthesis, software development
and post production.</li>
		<li>creativity and resourcefulness through the creation and composition of your own sonic projects</li>				
	</ol>
</div>

<div class=page-break></div>
	
<div class="course_info">
	<h4>ASSIGNMENTS AND GRADING</h4>
	<p>There will be 8 musical projects, most of which are composition assignments. There will also be reading and listening assignments which will be discussed in class. In addition, students are expected to attend <b>three</b> concerts of of electronic or computer music during the semester, and to submit 2 page reviews of each concert. The grading for each assignment is as follows:
	<ul style="margin-left: 20px">
		<li>Project 1 (5 pts): Field Recording - The Sounds of Your World</li>
		<li>Project 2 (5 pts): Sonic Sketch - The Sounds of Your World</li>		
		<li>Project 3 (10 pts): Composition 1 - Fixed Media</li>
		<hr style="margin:0; width:50%">
		<li>Project 4 (5 pts): Software Instrument with Max/MSP </li>
		<li>Project 5 (10 pts): Composition 2 - Real-time Performance with Max/MSP</li>
		<hr style="margin:0; width:50%">		
		<li>Project 6 (5 pts): ChucK drum machine</li>
		<li>Project 7 (10 pts): Composition 3 - Interactive Performance and Composition with ChucK</li>
		<hr style="margin:0; width:50%">		
<!--
		<li>Project 7 (5 pts): Web-Audio Sketch</li>
		<hr style="margin:0; width:50%">		
-->		
		<li>Project 8 (20 pts): Final Project (free composition)</li>
		<hr style="margin:0;width:50%">				
		<li>Total points for musical projects: 70 points</li>
	</ul>
	<ul style="margin-left: 20px">
		<li>Attendance/class participation: 15 pts</li>
<!--		<li>Reading/Listening Assignments: 10 points</li>	-->
		<li>3 Concert Reviews: 15 points</li>
	</ul>													
	</p>
</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4>EVALUATION</h4>
	<p>Evaluation is based on the following: 
	<ul style="margin-left: 20px">
<!--			<li>* A written mid-term test on digital audio theory and concepts from class (10%)</li> -->
			<li>Projects and compositions (70%)</li>
			<li>Attendance/class participation (15%)</li>
<!--			<li>Reading/Listening Assignments: (10%)</li> -->
			<li>Concert reviews (15%)</li>
		</ul>
</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4>CLASS PARTICIPATION</h4>
	<p>You will be required to present all of your musical assignments to the class, to show your work within the software environment you used to create it, and to engage the class in discussion of your work. When you are not presenting your own work, you need to be attentive to whoever is presenting, and to engage them in discussion of their work. <b>Failure to participate in class will lower your grade</b>.</p>
</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4>ATTENDANCE</h4>
	<p>You <b>must</b> attend class to succeed in this course. 
		<ol>
			<li>Since much of the class is focused on listening to and discussing work in class, attendance is <u>mandatory</u>.</li>
			<li>** More then two unexcused absences will affect your grade, detracting 1/2 grade each additional 2 unexcused absences. **</li>
			<li>Absences can only be excused by a letter from a medical doctor or from the Dean of Students' office.</li>			
			<li>Late arrivals are disruptive in Studio 110 - continued late arrival will affect your grade.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
</div>

<div class=page-break></div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4>CONCERT REVIEWS</h4>
	<p>
	You are required to attend and document at least three musical concerts or sound-based events during the semester. You may attend concerts from EMPAC, the “iEAR Presents” musical events events, or any other appropriate events you would like to attend on or off campus. They <b>MUST</b> be events in which live performed and technology-rich music or sound is the focus. A soundtrack to a film, for example, does NOT count. <em>If you are unsure as to whether a concert will satisfy this requirement please speak to the instructor.</em></p>
	<p>You will then need to submit via email a 2 page review of each performance which addresses both technical and aesthetic issues. Reviews should include both a description of the program, instrumentation (when appropriate), and a reasoned critique of the sonic materials and the performance. </p>
	<p>
		Examples of Concert Reviews can be found here: <a href="concertreviews.html">How to Write a Concert Review</a>	
	</p>
</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4>STUDIO RESOURCES</h4>
	<p>Throughout this course, you will make use the resources in the Undergraduate Computer Music Studio (WH110). Students enrolled in the course will have access to the studio 24 hours a day, and should expect to spend several hours working in the studio each week. You will also have access to recording equipment in the equipment room, which you will be checking out from time to time in order to make field recordings.</p>
	<p>When appropriate for an assignment, or to explore sound in general, we encourage the use of your own computer, electronic instruments, etc. Often times, smaller components of a large project can be done on your laptop or home studio facilities and then brought into the main studio to be mixed and mastered.</p>
</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4 style="background-color:#EBEBEB">STATEMENT REGARDING ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</h4>
	<p>Collaboration between students in this course is strongly encouraged. Likewise, students are encouraged—indeed, to some extent required—to exchange ideas, opinions and information . You are also encouraged to help each other in the lab and with performance, production, and presentation of composition projects.</p>
<p>Plagiarism of any kind is in direct violation of University policy on Academic Dishonesty asdefined in the Rensselaer Handbook, and penalties for plagiarism can be severe. In this class you will be expected to attribute due credit to the originator of any ideas, words, sounds, or music which you incorporate substantially into your own work. This applies particularly to citation of sources for sonic "samples" included in your compositions.</p>
<p>Submission of any assignment that is in violation of this policy may result in a grade of F for the assignment in question. Violation of this policy will be reported, as defined in the <em>Rensselaer Handbook</em></p>
</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4>DISABILITY SERVICES FOR STUDENTS</h4>
	<p>
		Students requiring assistance are encouraged to contact Disability Services: http://doso.rpi.edu/dss to discuss any special accommodations or needs for this course.
