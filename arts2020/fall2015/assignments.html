	<h4>Assignment #1: FIELD RECORDING</h4>
	<b><em>Assigned 9/2, Due 9/9</em></b></br>
	<p>The natural world around us is an amazing source of sound material. In this context however, the sounds of nature (i.e. burbling brooks, crying loons) are not necessarily the sounds that immerse us in our daily lives. Those sounds are the focus of this assignment, the sounds that make up our own personal Sound Worlds.</p>
	<p>Using a portable audio recorder, your assignment is to create a body of recorded samples that represent sounds from your world. These can be sounds that you consider: <em>beautiful, annoying, horrific, subtle, overt, background noise or foreground sonic experiences.</em>.</p>
	<p>
		<b>To successfully carry out this assignment please follow these instructions:</b>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Check out a portable audio recorder (and microphone if necessary) from the HASS Equipment Room (SAGE 1112).
			</li>
			<li>Familiarize yourself with its operation, specifically how to set the input level, how to record, how to play back your recording on the device, how to copy your files from the device (via USB) to your computer.</li>
			<li>Document the source of your recordings: this can be in the form of photos or video of your recording location/configuration, or as a written description of the material/location being recorded.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Your submission for the assignment will consist of the following files to be uploaded to your folder on the class share drive (<b>\\hass11.win.rpi.edu\classes\ARTS-2020\</b>), into a folder named "Assignment 1":</p>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Your set of at least 5 (no more than 10) high-quality samples.</li>
				<li>A visual or narrative description of each sample.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>You can contact the equipment room staff at (518) 276-4775, or online at hasshelp [at] rpi [dot] edu.</p>
	</p>
	<p>For the purposes of this assignment, please keep the following suggestions in mind:
		<ul>
			<li>* Set the recorder to record at a high sampling rate (e.g. 44.1kHz) and a bit rate of 16 bit or higher.</li>
			<li>* Make sure the input level for the microphone is set high enough to capture the type of sound that has drawn your attention.</li>
			<li>* Test your setup early and often. TAPE IS CHEAP. If you're not absolutely sure you captured the sound the way you would like, listen to your recording on the spot. Iterate until it sounds the way you'd like.</li>
			<li>* Please respect the privacy of people or material that might wander into your recording. In general, distinct voices or audible musical sources (i.e. radios, music in general) might not be the best source material for this exercise.</li>			
			<li>* gl hf dd</li>						
		</ol>		
		<ul>
			<li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p><b>Things to keep in mind:</b> This can be a field recording of an environment, or a recording of an object. You should make sure that the recording is done WELL, with a good signal-to-noise ratio, and a minimum of external body noises/mic noises/etc. The length is not as important as the quality, and the characteristics of the sound. You will be working with this recording for the next assignment so think about what you want to do and explore sound through the recorder.</p>

	<h4>Assignment #2: FOUND-SOUND SKETCH</h4>
	<b><em>Assigned 9/9, Due 9/16</em></b></br>
	<p>Compose a sonic sketch within <strong>Pro Tools</strong> using as source material the audio samples you recorded for Assignment #1. This sketch should display your ability to edit and manipulate sound files, as well as organize multiple sonic sources into a cohesive composition.</p>
	<p>This sonic sketch should be approximately <strong><em>3-5 minutes in length</em></strong>.</p>
	<p>Along with the sonic sketch, please submit a <strong><em>visual "reference score"</em></strong> for your work: a .pdf document displaying visually the organizational structures with which you created your sketch. This visual score should be analagous to a written musical score, acting as a deptiction of your work's structure and intention as the work unfolds in time.</p>

	<p>
		<p>Your submission for the assignment will consist of the following files to be uploaded to your folder on the class share drive (<b>\\hass11.win.rpi.edu\classes\ARTS-2020\</b>), into a folder named "Assignment 2":</p>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>A Stereo Mix of your sketch (44.1 kHz, 16 or 24 bit) uploaded to the class share.</li>
				<li>The location of your Pro Tools project on the class share.</li>
				<li>A brief program-note for your sketch, including a title and description of your work (suitable for a concert's program).</li>
				<li>A list of the samples used in your work, including their source, file-name and proper attribution for the creator of the sample.</li>				
			</ol>
		</p>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Please consider making use of the techniques we learned in class such as fading your files in and out, panning and volume automations. Feel free to experiment with effects on your channel inserts, compression, limiting, denoising and normalization.

	<p><b>Things to keep in mind:</b> This sketch can take multiple forms depending on your interest. Possibilities include an exploration of ALL the sounds you previously recorded or an in-depth study of one particular sound file or source. Your work can be atmospheric, like a soundscape, with the intention of depicting a specific place and time. Or, your work can be more "musical" in nature, using your recorded sound sources as instruments within a composed structure.</p>

	<h4>Assignment #2: FIELD RECORDING</h4>
	<b><em>Assigned 9/2, Due 9/9</em></b></br>
 Ultimately, you may which to work within one of the following studio composition "genres" which we will talk more about as we go along:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Soundscape Composition:</b> Following Hildegard Westerkamp’s definition (see the reading on-line), a composition which uses as it’s material a recorded environment, not abstracted, making audible it’s relationship to the original source, or to a place, time, or situation.</li>

<li><b>Musique Concrete Composition: A sound piece which makes use of a recorded object, environment, instrument, etc, as sound material for abstract composition. Here the interest is perhaps more in musical form and structure.</li>


<li><b>Single Sound Source Composition: A sound piece made by transforming and generating material out of a single sound source, such as a drop of water, a car engine, a dog barking, etc.</li>


<li><b>Other ideas that interest YOU. Your composition can be environmental/ ambient or be based on traditional musical structures/ chords/ rhythms etc.</li>
</div>

<!--
For the tascam dap1 DAT recorder, make sure to have the following settings:
audio input: analog
analog input: mic
sampling rate: 44.1K samples/second
phantom power: on
put in “record mode”
visually monitor levels on the meter and listen to the sound through headphones.
keep the level below “0” Db.
This can be a field recording of an environment, or a recording of an object. You should make sure that the recording is done WELL, with a good signal-to-noise ratio, and a minimum of external body noises/mic noises/etc. The length is not as important as the quality, and the characteristics of the sound. You will be working with this recording for the next several weeks so think about what you want to do and explore sound through the recorder. Ultimately, you may which to work within one of the following studio composition “genres” which we will talk more about as we go along:

	<h4>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h4>
	<p>This course is an introduction to music and "sound-art" created through the use of computers and electronics. This is a studio course, and students will be expected to participate creatively in class by listening, taking an active role in discussions, and making your own work through significant, intelligent uses of technology. Although a component of this class includes learning how to use computers and other technological tools, this is not a "how-to-use technology" course. We will focus primarily on learning enough about technology to realize personal creative projects.</p>
</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4>CATALOG DESCRIPTION</h4>
	<p>Music composition taught in the context of modern computerized production methods.

		<li>Reading/Listening Assignments: 10 points</li>						
		<li>3 Concert Reviews: 5 points</li>
	</ul>													
	</p>
</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4>EVALUATION</h4>
	<p>Evaluation is based on the following: 
	<ul style="margin-left: 20px">

			<li>* A written mid-term test on digital audio theory and concepts from class (10%)</li>
			<li>Projects and compositions (70%)</li>
			<li>Attendance/class participation (15%)</li>
			<li>Reading/Listening Assignments: (10%)</li>
			<li>Concert reviews (5%)</li>
		</ul>
			<p>Since much of the class is focused on listening to and discussing work in class, attendance is mandatory. More then two unexcused absences will affect your grade, detracting 1/2 grade each additional 2 unexcused absences.</p>
</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4>CLASS PARTICIPATION</h4>
	<p>You will be required to present all of your musical assignments to the class, to show your work within the software environment you used to create it, and to engage the class in discussion of your work. When you are not presenting your own work, you need to be attentive to whoever is presenting, and to engage them in discussion of their work. Failure to participate in class will lower your grade.</p>
</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4>ATTENDANCE</h4>
	<p>You must attend class to succeed in this course. Attendance will be taken, and three unexcused absences will reduce your final grade by one full letter grade. Each additional unexcused absence will reduce your final grade by another half-letter grade. Five unexcused absences will result in an F for the course. Don't do this. Absensces can only be excused by a letter from a medical doctor or from the Dean of Students' office.</p>
</div>

<div class=page-break></div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4>CONCERT REVIEWS</h4>
	<p>
	You are required to attend at least three musical concerts our sound-based events during the semester. You may attend concerts from the “iEAR Presents” musical events events, or any other events you would like to attend on or off campus. They MUST be events in which live performed music or sound is the focus. A soundtrack to a film, for example, does NOT count. <em>If you are unsure as to whether a concert will satisfy this requirement please speak to the instructor.</em></p>
	<p>You will then need to submit via email a 1-2 page review of each performance which addresses both technical and aesthetic issues. Reviews should include both a description of the program, instrumentation (when appropriate), and a reasoned critique of the sonic materials and the performance. </p>
</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4>STUDIO RESOURCES</h4>
	<p>Throughout this course, you will make use the resources in the Undergraduate Computer Music Studio (WH110). Students enrolled in the course will have access to the studio 24 hours a day, and should expect to spend several hours working in the studio each week. You will also have access to recording equipment in the equipment room, which you will be checking out from time to time in order to make field recordings.</p>
<p>When appropriate for an assignment, or to explore sound in general, we encourage the use of your own computer, electronic instruments, etc. Often times, smaller components of a large project can be done on your laptop or home studio facilities and then brought into the main studio to be mixed and mastered.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="course_info">
	<h4 style="background-color:#EBEBEB">STATEMENT REGARDING ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</h4>
	<p>Collaboration between students in this course is strongly encouraged. Likewise, students are encouraged—indeed, to some extent required—to exchange ideas, opinions and information . You are also encouraged to help each other in the lab and with performance, production, and presentation of composition projects.</p>
<p>Plagiarism of any kind is in direct violation of University policy on Academic Dishonesty asdefined in the Rensselaer Handbook, and penalties for plagiarism can be severe. In this class you will be expected to attribute due credit to the originator of any ideas, words, sounds, or music which you incorporate substantially into your own work. This applies particularly to citation of sources for sonic “samples” included in your compositions.</p>
<p>Submission of any assignment that is in violation of this policy may result in a grade of F for the assignment in question. Violation of this policy will be reported, as defined in the <em>Rensselaer Handbook</em></p>
