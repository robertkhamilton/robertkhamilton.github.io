	<h4>Assignment #1: SOUND EFFECTS: FIELD RECORDING</h4>
	<b><em>Assigned 9/9, Due 9/20</em></b></br>
	<p>The natural world around us (including... well, "us") is an amazing source of sound material. </p>
	<p>Using a portable audio recorder, your assignment is to create a set of recorded samples that represent "found" sounds that could be re-purposed into the sonic fabric of your game. For the purposes of this assignment we will be using Unity's built-in sound capabilities such as Audio Clips and Audio Sources, trigger volumes and continuous/environmental data.</em>.</p>
	<p>To convert your raw material into musical and sonic effects that "fit" your game space, explore the capabilities of Audacity to process your sound files in creative and transformative ways.</p>
	<p>Using these sounds pulled from everyday life (i.e. not downloaded from freesounds.org or ripped from your music collection), create a set of sound and musical effects for _either_ the Roll-a-Ball or spaceship demos from class, OR for a small game experience of your own design.</p>
	<p>
		<b>To successfully carry out this assignment please follow these instructions:</b>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Check out a portable audio recorder (and microphone if necessary) from the HASS Equipment Room (SAGE 1112).
			</li>
			<li>Familiarize yourself with its operation, specifically how to set the input level, how to record, how to play back your recording on the device, how to copy your files from the device (via USB) to your computer.</li>
			<li>Document the source of your recordings: this can be in the form of photos or video of your recording location/configuration, or as a written description of the material/location being recorded.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Please use sound in a variety of functional roles in your game, including (but not limited to):
			<ol>
				<li>Discretized sound events (like jumping, firing, pickup triggers, keyboard/mouse-button events)</li>
				<li>Longer or continuous/looping sound events</li>
				<li>"Background" music</li>
				<li>Think about creating multiple samples for a given event and choosing different samples either randomly or based on gameplay values.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<p> Please turn in the following:
			<ol>
				<li>Your set of samples: both your original "clean" sounds and your processed/manipulated sounds.</li>
				<li>A simple narrative description of each sample and how it is used in the game.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>You can contact the equipment room staff at (518) 276-4775, or online at hasshelp [at] rpi [dot] edu.</p>
	</p>
	<p>For the purposes of this assignment, please keep the following suggestions in mind:
		<ul>
			<li>* Set the recorder to record at a high sampling rate (e.g. 44.1kHz) and a bit rate of 16 bit or higher.</li>
			<li>* Make sure the input level for the microphone is set high enough to capture the type of sound that has drawn your attention.</li>
			<li>* Test your setup early and often. TAPE IS CHEAP. If you're not absolutely sure you captured the sound the way you would like, listen to your recording on the spot. Iterate until it sounds the way you'd like.</li>
			<li>* Please respect the privacy of people or material that might wander into your recording. In general, distinct voices or audible musical sources (i.e. radios, music in general) might not be the best source material for this exercise.</li>

	<h4>Assignment #2: SOUND ROOM PROPOSAL</h4>
	<b><em>Assigned 9/23, Due 9/27</em></b></br>
	<p>To correspond with the <a href="http://newatlantis.world/">New Atlantis</a> project's October 10 concert, we will be designing and building a series of music and sound environments for real-time network performance. As a group we can decide what kinds of sonic and visual experiences we wish to contribute to the project, either a few large ideas or a larger number of smaller ideas.</p>
	<p>For assignment #2, please design a sonic and visual interaction that you would like to propose the class work on for the concert. The specs require the project run within Unity and for the time being, they should use the built-in audio features of Unity (i.e. no PD yet).</p>	
	<p>In a written (basic) game design document, propose a "Sound Room" for inclusion in the New Atlantis project. Please describe your proposed idea, including if possible, visual sketches, descriptions of the proposed interactions, and descriptions or links to reference audio material.</p>
	<p>A sample (more advanced) game design document used in the Experimental Game Design class can be found <a href="http://www.hass.rpi.edu/public_html/ruiz/EGDFall2013/GameDesignDocumentTemplate.doc">here</a>.</p>
	<p>Your design should include the following:
		<ol>
			<li>A high-level overview of your idea.</li>
			<li>Details about how you envision the user interactions to work with Unity</li>
		</ol>
	</p>	
	<p>Please keep in mind that the goal of this document is to make your ideas clear to your classmates, so that we may all choose projects to work on for next week.</p>

	<h4>Assignment #3: New Atlantis</h4>
	<b><em>Assigned 10/28, Due 11/11</em></b></br>	
	<p>Following our class participation in the New Atlantis project, this assignment asks you to submit your New Atlantis musical/sound world project as a zipped Unity project and/or NA bundle. </p>

	<p>Please submit the following:
		
		<ul>
			<li>Your New Atlantis Unity project, zipped up</li>
			<li>A brief paragraph description of the project (one per team) describing the sonic and game interactions and an overview of the project itself.</li>
			<li>For members of teams (not necessary for solo projects) a brief paragraph describing your individual role on the team and your thoughts on how successfully or unsuccessfully your team was able to work together.</li>
		</ul>

	<h4>Assignment #4: Sound-Only Game</h4>
	<b><em>Assigned 10/28, Due 11/11</em></b></br>	
	<p>For this assignment, build an interactive music game where the primary player interaction and gameplay is conveyed via sound and music. For this project your audio engine should be built within Pure Data.</p>
	<p>The game can have no visible user-interface or a minimal user-interface, the choice is yours. What is important is that information you wish to convey to your players in primarily conveyed via sound and music. </p>
	<p>Your game can be built entirely in Pure Data or you can use Pure Data as the audio backend to a front end built in Unity, MobMuPlat, or any other OSC-capable interface.</p>
</div>

For the tascam dap1 DAT recorder, make sure to have the following settings:
audio input: analog
analog input: mic
sampling rate: 44.1K samples/second
phantom power: on
put in “record mode”
visually monitor levels on the meter and listen to the sound through headphones.
keep the level below “0” Db.
This can be a field recording of an environment, or a recording of an object. You should make sure that the recording is done WELL, with a good signal-to-noise ratio, and a minimum of external body noises/mic noises/etc. The length is not as important as the quality, and the characteristics of the sound. You will be working with this recording for the next several weeks so think about what you want to do and explore sound through the recorder. Ultimately, you may which to work within one of the following studio composition “genres” which we will talk more about as we go along:

	<h4>Assignment #2: FOUND-SOUND SKETCH</h4>
	<b><em>Assigned 2/1, Due 2/8</em></b></br>
	<p>Compose a sonic sketch within <strong>Pro Tools</strong> using as source material the audio samples you recorded for Assignment #1. This sketch should display your ability to edit and manipulate sound files, as well as organize multiple sonic sources into a cohesive composition.</p>
	<p>This sonic sketch should be approximately <strong><em>3-5 minutes in length</em></strong>.</p>
	<p>Along with the sonic sketch, please submit a <strong><em>visual "reference score"</em></strong> for your work: a .pdf document displaying visually the organizational structures with which you created your sketch. This visual score should be analagous to a written musical score, acting as a deptiction of your work's structure and intention as the work unfolds in time.</p>

	<p>
		<p>Your submission for the assignment will consist of the following files to be uploaded to your folder on the class share drive (<b>\\hass11.win.rpi.edu\classes\ARTS-2020\</b>), into a folder named "Assignment 2":</p>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>A Stereo Mix of your sketch (44.1 kHz, 16 or 24 bit) uploaded to the class share.</li>
				<li>The location of your Pro Tools project on the class share.</li>
				<li>A brief program-note for your sketch, including a title and description of your work (suitable for a concert's program).</li>
				<li>A list of the samples used in your work, including their source, file-name and proper attribution for the creator of the sample.</li>				
			</ol>
		</p>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Please consider making use of the techniques we learned in class such as fading your files in and out, panning and volume automations. Feel free to experiment with effects on your channel inserts, compression, limiting, denoising and normalization.
	</p>
	<p><b>Things to keep in mind:</b> This sketch can take multiple forms depending on your interest. Possibilities include an exploration of ALL the sounds you previously recorded or an in-depth study of one particular sound file or source. Your work can be atmospheric, like a soundscape, with the intention of depicting a specific place and time. Or, your work can be more "musical" in nature, using your recorded sound sources as instruments within a composed structure.</p>
