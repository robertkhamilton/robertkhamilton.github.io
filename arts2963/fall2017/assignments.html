	<h4>Assignment #1: SINGLE-SOURCED GAME AUDIO SCENE</h4>
	<b><em>Due Monday, 9/25</em></b></br>
				<br/><br/>
				Using your 30-second block from the in-class challenge, populate a simple game scene with your sounds. You can make use of the scenes shown in class (Roll-a-Ball, Simple Shooter), Unity example scenes or a game scene of your own making.
				<br/><br/>
				The success of your scene will revolve around whether or not your scene feels coherent, i.e. all the sounds exist in the same space. Coherence can be helped by creative use of reverberation in game, by careful editing of sounds in Audacity, or simply through artistic choices you make in your role as sound-designer.
				<br/><br/>
				Please include examples of the following Unity audio processes in your scene:<br/>
				<br/>
				<ul>
					<dl>* Audio Source (multiple)</dl>
					<dl>* Mixer Groups</dl>
					<dl>* Basic C# scripting of audio playback events</dl>
					<dl>* Varying pitch, amplitude, etc.</dl>
					<dl>* 3D sound/distance-based attenuation</dl>
					<dl>* Sounds triggered through collision</dl>
					<dl>* A looping background "musical" track</dl>
				</ul>

	<h4>Assignment #2: Sound-Only Game</h4>
	<b><em>Assigned 10/10, Due 10/26</em></b></br>	
	<p>For this assignment, build an interactive music game where the primary player interaction and gameplay is conveyed via sound and music. For this project your audio engine should be built within Pure Data.</p>
	<p>The game can have no visible user-interface or a minimal user-interface, the choice is yours. What is important is that information you wish to convey to your players in primarily conveyed via sound and music. </p>
	<p>Your game can be built entirely in Pure Data or you can use Pure Data as the audio backend to a front end built in Unity, MobMuPlat, or any other OSC-capable interface.</p>
</div>
<!--


For the tascam dap1 DAT recorder, make sure to have the following settings:
audio input: analog
analog input: mic
sampling rate: 44.1K samples/second
phantom power: on
put in “record mode”
visually monitor levels on the meter and listen to the sound through headphones.
keep the level below “0” Db.
This can be a field recording of an environment, or a recording of an object. You should make sure that the recording is done WELL, with a good signal-to-noise ratio, and a minimum of external body noises/mic noises/etc. The length is not as important as the quality, and the characteristics of the sound. You will be working with this recording for the next several weeks so think about what you want to do and explore sound through the recorder. Ultimately, you may which to work within one of the following studio composition “genres” which we will talk more about as we go along:

	<h4>Assignment #2: FOUND-SOUND SKETCH</h4>
	<b><em>Assigned 2/1, Due 2/8</em></b></br>
	<p>Compose a sonic sketch within <strong>Pro Tools</strong> using as source material the audio samples you recorded for Assignment #1. This sketch should display your ability to edit and manipulate sound files, as well as organize multiple sonic sources into a cohesive composition.</p>
	<p>This sonic sketch should be approximately <strong><em>3-5 minutes in length</em></strong>.</p>
	<p>Along with the sonic sketch, please submit a <strong><em>visual "reference score"</em></strong> for your work: a .pdf document displaying visually the organizational structures with which you created your sketch. This visual score should be analagous to a written musical score, acting as a deptiction of your work's structure and intention as the work unfolds in time.</p>

	<p>
		<p>Your submission for the assignment will consist of the following files to be uploaded to your folder on the class share drive (<b>\\hass11.win.rpi.edu\classes\ARTS-2020\</b>), into a folder named "Assignment 2":</p>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>A Stereo Mix of your sketch (44.1 kHz, 16 or 24 bit) uploaded to the class share.</li>
				<li>The location of your Pro Tools project on the class share.</li>
				<li>A brief program-note for your sketch, including a title and description of your work (suitable for a concert's program).</li>
				<li>A list of the samples used in your work, including their source, file-name and proper attribution for the creator of the sample.</li>				
			</ol>
		</p>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Please consider making use of the techniques we learned in class such as fading your files in and out, panning and volume automations. Feel free to experiment with effects on your channel inserts, compression, limiting, denoising and normalization.
	</p>
	<p><b>Things to keep in mind:</b> This sketch can take multiple forms depending on your interest. Possibilities include an exploration of ALL the sounds you previously recorded or an in-depth study of one particular sound file or source. Your work can be atmospheric, like a soundscape, with the intention of depicting a specific place and time. Or, your work can be more "musical" in nature, using your recorded sound sources as instruments within a composed structure.</p>

	<h4>Assignment #3: Fixed-Media Composition and/or Editing</h4>
	<b><em>Assigned 2/17, Due 3/2</em></b></br>
	<p>To complete this assignment please do one of the following (or do both for extra-credit:)</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Compose a "musical" work in fixed media showcasing significantly more melodic and rhythmic structure than in the Sonic Sketch assignment. This composiiton should be approximately 4-6 minutes in length.</li>
		or
		<li>Using the "Trucks" stems (guitar, vocals, click) found on the Class share drive produce your own version of "Trucks". You can approach the source material from a number of directions such as making a "high-quality" recording out of the raw materials, or by using it as source material for a creative re-arrangement.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		<p>For either option, make use of MIDI and/or synthesis-based sound sources in addition to your own audio-source materials or the "Trucks" source.
